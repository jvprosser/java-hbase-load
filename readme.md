# HBase 1.0 API Example

HBase 1.0 has cleaned up the client API. This is an example application to
demonstrate the old API vs. the new.

## Usage

This project contains two example classes, one using the old API and the other
using the new. The examples are intended to compile. The `pom.xml` has
dependency sections for old and new versions. New dependencies are enabled by
default.
